# Excel_AlextheAnalystProjects

These are projects from the Alex the Analyst Youtube Channel.

The cleaned file is a worksheet of US Presidents that has been cleaned with Remove Duplicates, the Trim function, the Proper function, and correct formatting of the dates.

The excel project includes a dataset of bikes sales. The finished project includes the bikes sales datasheet, a copy of that datasheet that was cleaned, pivot tables from the sales dataset, and a dashboard with the pivot table removed and only the charts from the pivot table data. The dataset does not provide a column of bike sales, bike clothes, and bike accessories. It just has a column that says whether the customer bought a bike or did not buy a bike (yes or no). This sort of makes the pivots confusing and doesn't specify if the commuting distance of the customers are in the bike or in a car. So the column asking if a customer bought a bike or did not buy a bike is not really helpful in my opinion.
